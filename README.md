# Web3 Patreon - Decentralized Creator Platform

> Built for the Walrus Haulout Hackathon 2024

A fully decentralized Patreon alternative built on the Sui Stack, featuring encrypted content storage with Seal and distributed hosting on Walrus.

## 🌟 Overview

Web3 Patreon empowers creators to monetize their content directly on-chain without intermediaries. Fans get transparent, verifiable access to exclusive content, and creators maintain full ownership of their identity and content.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Creator Profiles**: Portable, on-chain identity that persists beyond any single platform
- **Encrypted Content**: All private content encrypted with Seal protocol
- **Decentralized Storage**: Content stored on Walrus for censorship resistance
- **Subscription NFTs**: Tradeable, transferable membership tokens
- **Direct Payments**: 100% of subscription fees go directly to creators
- **Multiple Tiers**: Create unlimited subscription tiers with custom pricing
- **Tips**: Direct tipping functionality for instant support

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Sui (Smart contracts in Move)
- **Storage**: Walrus Protocol (Decentralized blob storage)
- **Encryption**: Seal Protocol (Real @mysten/seal SDK with production key servers)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Wallet**: @mysten/dapp-kit

### Smart Contracts

Four core Move modules power the platform:

1. **creator_profile.move** - Profile management and creator identity
2. **subscription.move** - Subscription tiers and membership NFTs  
3. **content.move** - Content posts and access control
4. **payment.move** - Tipping and revenue tracking

### Data Flow

```
Creator uploads content
    ↓
1. Content encrypted with Seal (access policy created)
    ↓
2. Encrypted data uploaded to Walrus (blob ID returned)
    ↓
3. On-chain record created (blob ID + policy ID stored)
    ↓
Fan subscribes
    ↓
4. Subscription NFT minted and transferred to fan
    ↓
5. Fan can now decrypt and view content
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Sui CLI
- A Sui wallet (Sui Wallet, Suiet, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd wal

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Build Move contracts (already deployed)
cd ../contracts
sui move build
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUI_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALRUS_PUBLISHER=https://publisher.walrus-testnet.walrus.space
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALRUS_AGGREGATOR=https://aggregator.walrus-testnet.walrus.space
NEXT_PUBLIC_PACKAGE_ID=0xdbd66ba1348f60cdac421c2da4a09d2f56a48fa64963307b3842896258723e35
```

### Running Locally

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 💾 **IndexedDB Content Cache**

### **What is it?**
To avoid re-decryption and re-signing on every page refresh, decrypted content is automatically cached in the browser's **IndexedDB** (local storage).

### **Benefits:**
- ⚡ **Instant Load**: Second time viewing content = 0.1 seconds (vs 5-8 seconds)
- 🔑 **No Re-sign**: SessionKey is reused from localStorage
- 🔓 **No Re-decrypt**: Decrypted content loaded from IndexedDB
- 🌐 **No Blockchain Call**: Zero Seal SDK overhead after first load

### **Cache Behavior:**
- **Max Size**: 20MB per content (larger files are not cached)
- **Duration**: 8 hours (automatically cleaned up)
- **Storage**: Browser's IndexedDB (separate from localStorage)
- **Security**: Cleared on logout, subscription cancel, or expiry

### **How to Monitor:**
Add the `<CacheStats />` component to any page to see cache statistics:

```typescript
import { CacheStats } from "@/components/cache/CacheStats";

// In your page component:
<CacheStats />
```

### **Cache Locations:**
- `frontend/lib/cache/indexed-db-cache.ts` - Core implementation
- `frontend/components/content/ContentViewer.tsx` - Integrated (read/write)
- `frontend/components/auth/WalletButton.tsx` - Clear on logout
- `frontend/components/cache/CacheStats.tsx` - Stats component (optional)

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- All non-public content is encrypted with **real Seal SDK** (Identity-Based Encryption)
- Uses **threshold cryptography** (1-of-2 key servers) for decentralized key management
- Encryption keys are managed on-chain via access policies
- Subscription verification happens on-chain (trustless)
- No centralized server can access encrypted content
- Walrus ensures content is distributed and always available
- **File size limit**: 5MB per upload (optimized for Seal encryption performance)

## 🎯 Hackathon Tracks

This project fits into the following tracks:

### Primary Track: **Data Security & Privacy**
- Implements Seal encryption for content protection
- On-chain access control via Subscription NFTs
- Zero-knowledge content access verification

### Secondary Track: **Data Economy/Marketplaces**
- Creates a marketplace for creator content
- Tradeable subscription NFTs
- Direct creator-fan economic relationships
